## Course Overview
These notes cover the Discrete Stochastic Analysis course held at SNS. 

### Main Topics:
* **Markov Chains:** Transition matrices, irreducibility, and stationary distributions.
* **Random Walks:** Analysis on graphs and $\mathbb{Z}^d$.
* **Martingales:** Stopping times and convergence theorems.

> **Note to self:** Re-check the proof for the Optional Stopping Theorem in Lecture 12.
